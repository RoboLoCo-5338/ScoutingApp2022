# ScoutingApp2022

This is  the scouting app that will be used to keep track of other teams' performance at competitions.

## To Download Python

First download Python by going to this link:
https://www.python.org/downloads/

![Alt text](assets/python_download_btn_img.png?raw=true "Download Python button")

Click the big yellow button that says `Download Python 3.X.X`. Once downloaded, wait for instructions. If you already know how to install Python, continue as usual, but **make sure to click the checkbox to add Python to the PATH**.

## To Download This Application

Once Python is downloaded, go back to the GitHub page with this ReadMe. Now download the code by clicking the green `Code` button and click `Download ZIP` from the menu that drops down.

![Alt text](assets/download_zip_img.png?raw=true "Downloading the ZIP file")

Extract the contents of the ZIP file and put them in a location that is easy for you to access. To do this, open the ZIP file and you should see a single folder inside. Click and drag this folder to the outer folder that contains the ZIP file. This action is demonstrated below.

![Alt text](assets/extract_folder_gif.gif?raw=true "Demonstrating how to extract the ZIP")

Open the folder titled `ScoutingApp2022-main` and then click the address bar containing the file path (click on the empty right side of the address bar, where there is just whitespace and no text), so that it highlights the path in blue. Then type `cmd` and press enter. This action is demonstrated below. A black terminal window should appear with white text in which the bottom line has the file path that you just clicked on.

![Alt text](assets/address_bar_img.png?raw=true "The file explorer address bar")
![Alt text](assets/address_bar_clicked_img.png?raw=true "The highlighted address bar")
![Alt text](assets/address_bar_cmd_img.png?raw=true "Typing cmd in the address bar")

Then with the blinking cursor active on that line, paste in the following command:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

![Alt text](assets/cmd_requirements_img.png?raw=true "Installing dependencies in cmd")

Press enter and wait for all of those dependencies to install. **Do not type anything until a new terminal line has appeared with your file path followed by a blinking cursor.**

Then paste this command into the next terminal line: `python app.py`. Press enter. Ignore the red warning that appears. Finally, paste the url given in the last line of the output (seen in the red box in the image below) into a browser. Do not close the terminal while using the scouting app.

## To Use This Application

![Alt text](assets/team_name_entry.png?raw=true "Team name entry")

First you will see a page to enter the team number of the team that you will be scouting. Note that it will tell you to `Please match the requested format.` and not allow you to proceed if you enter any characters that are not digits. After entering the number, click the blue `Start Session` button.

![Alt text](assets/autonomous_select_img.png?raw=true "Autonomous select")

During the autonomous period, select `Yes` to the autonomous mode option at the top. During the rest of the match, have `No` selected for autonomous mode option at the top. Track the team's performance during autonomous with the buttons below. **When autonomous is over, scroll down to the bottom and click the blue `Submit Session` button. Then start a new session for the teleop period. The autonomous performance is submitted separately from the teleop performance.**

![Alt text](assets/goal_adding.png?raw=true "Goal adding buttons")

Click the `High Goal` and `Low Goal` buttons each time the team scores a high or low goal, respectively. Click the `Oopsy` button to subtract a goal that was accidentally added.

![Alt text](assets/climb_score_entry.png?raw=true "Selection of climb height")

At the end of the match, select the highest climbing bar reached by the robot.

![Alt text](assets/defense_select.png?raw=true "Selection of whether it is a defense bot")

Some bots specialize in being defensive rather than scoring points themselves. If this is the case for the team you are observing, select `Yes` and make note of how well they defend in the `Notes` section described below. Otherwise, just select `No`.

![Alt text](assets/penalties_select.png?raw=true "Selection of penalties against the team")

If any penalties are given against the team, select whether they got a red card or a yellow card with the colored buttons.

Enter any additional notes on the team's performance in the `Notes` section.

When the autonomous period is over, click the blue `Submit Session` button at the bottom to submit the data. Do the same at the end of the match to submit the teleop observations.
